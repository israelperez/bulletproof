# Bulletproof Frontend Test
Implement a small Angular JS application that lets the user log in and redirects him afterwards.
 
Requirements:

- Scaffold a Angular app
- Create a login screen that lets the user enter a username (email) and password
    - Form should validate that a valid email address has been entered (xx@xx.xxx)
    - Create a service that mocks the validation (i.e. no need to create an actual back end, just implement a service that validates the login)
- After login, redirect user to a new page
 
Technologies:

- If this can be scaffolded with Yeoman that would be great
- Bootstrap 3
- Angular 1.3.x
